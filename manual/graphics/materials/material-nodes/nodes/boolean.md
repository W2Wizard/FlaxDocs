# Booleans

## Explanation
Flax supports using booleans in the material graph, this can be very helpful to apply conditional checks like using one texture or another for instance. All operators are supported as well as using switches depending on the state of a bool.

## Example

Below is a simple example for what booleans can be used for. If we were to make a material instance we can could then just change the value of the bool and it will be blue instead of red for example.
